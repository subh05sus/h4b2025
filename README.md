# 🤖 Cypher AI – Your Emotion-Aware Coding Companion

> “Not just a coding assistant — a mentor, a holographic friend, and a mindful productivity partner.”

Cypher AI is a next-generation AI-powered companion designed to make the coding experience more human, engaging, and focused. Unlike traditional developer tools that stop at code suggestions, Cypher AI brings real-time emotional awareness, distraction detection, and even physical presence through a holographic avatar — powered by Gemini’s AI.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 Emotion-Aware Feedback
- Uses Gemini’s AI to detect emotional states via your laptop webcam.
- Encourages breaks when you're overwhelmed or feeling low.
- Responds with motivational nudges to improve mental well-being during deep work.

### 📵 Distraction Detection
- Detects real-world distractions like picking up your phone using object recognition.
- Sends real-time prompts to help you regain focus and build better coding habits.

### 💬 Intelligent Coding Support
- Understands live code context just like GitHub Copilot.
- Provides fixes, feedback, and mentor-style guidance.
- Can simulate technical interviews by asking context-relevant coding questions.

### 🌈 Holographic Avatar Projection
- The AI companion is visualized as a hologram using a glass pane and a projector.
- Brings a physical, lifelike presence to your workspace.
- Makes the assistant feel like a real companion — not just text on a screen.

## 🛠 Challenges We Ran Into

- We experimented with several emotion and object detection models before selecting Gemini’s AI, which gave us the most robust results tailored to our use case.
- Building a real-time webcam-to-backend pipeline with low latency was technically tricky and required threading, frame optimization, and a lot of testing.
- Setting up the hologram physically — aligning projections on a glass pane for clarity and realism — was a first-time experience. It was challenging but rewarding once we got it working smoothly.
- Coordinating different modules under time pressure was difficult, especially when we lost our team leader to… an extended bathroom emergency (yes, real story) due to stomach issues. That momentary manpower dip made things a bit chaotic — but we pulled through together.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Coding today can feel robotic and isolating. Most tools help you write better code — but they don’t check in with how you’re doing, how focused you are, or what you're struggling with emotionally.

Cypher AI is built for:
- Students coding late into the night.
- Developers preparing for interviews.
- Anyone who wants more than a silent tool — a friend, a guide, a voice.

It’s about better code — but also a better coding experience.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Add voice-based interactions using speech recognition and TTS.
- Integrate support for multiple AI “personas” (e.g. strict mentor, chill friend, etc.)
- Build desktop-first companion apps for students and remote devs.
- Enable journaling/mood-tracking features alongside code logs.

## 👥 Team

Built with caffeine, chaos, and care at Hack4Bengal 2025 ❤️  
Big love to everyone who stayed up debugging, testing, and re-aligning the hologram pane 42 times.
